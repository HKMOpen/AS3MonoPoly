# AS3MonoPoly
==================
A project from 2005

A simple mono game

I don't want to die or getting lost. I have already lost the 2.0 developed version where I could not dig up my damaged hard disk. Here I found google project hosting is quite useful and it can save all my given up projects. If anyone wants or interested in this project, here I have all the source files. Please contact me about your plan and development.

Collaboration is welcome.
